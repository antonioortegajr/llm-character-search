using llms to find characters

## About

This repo was started because I am a Dr. Doom fan. He may not always have his own title but is often in the description. Using Marvels API can pass the description to an LLM to guess if Doom is in the comic.

## Use

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

. venv/bin/activate

python main.py
